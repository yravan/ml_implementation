# RL Framework for Sequential Decision Making
# Based on MIT 6.484 Lecture Notes

"""
Comprehensive Reinforcement Learning Framework
==============================================

This framework provides practical implementations and utilities for
training and testing RL algorithms from the lecture notes.

Modules:
- environments: Wrapper classes for Gymnasium environments
- networks: Neural network architectures for policies and value functions
- buffers: Experience replay and trajectory buffers
- utils: Training utilities, logging, and visualization
- algorithms: Base classes for RL algorithms
